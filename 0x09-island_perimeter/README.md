# Island Perimeter
This project involves solving a geometric problem within a grid context by calculating the perimeter of a single island represented in a 2D array.

Problem Description
Given a 2D grid where:

0 represents water.
1 represents land.
Each cell is square with a side length of 1.
Cells are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
The grid is completely surrounded by water.
There is only one island (or nothing), and it does not contain any internal water (lakes).
Project Details
Concepts Utilized
2D Arrays (Matrices):
Accessing and iterating over elements.
Navigating through adjacent cells.
Conditional Logic:
Applying conditions to determine the contribution of each cell to the perimeter.
Counting Techniques:
Developing a method to count the edges contributing to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
Python Programming:
Using nested loops and conditional statements.
Requirements
Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.4.3.
Editors: Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
Coding Style: Follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7).
Documentation: All modules and functions must be documented.
Execution: All files must be executable.
Tasks
Task 0: Island Perimeter
Implement a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in the input grid.
